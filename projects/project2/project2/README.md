# Project 2: Blob Escape

This simulation was made as a look back on what I have learned by far in the world of programming. I wished to combine all that was learned in the span of four months into a simple game that showcases my skills, creativity and aesthetic. This simulation was made to be simple and straightforward so any person understand and play through the game (and hopefully enjoy).

“Blob Escape” is a small game where a little slime, controlled by the user, has to face many small challenges to go to the next room. The player eventually finds the exit from the maze and clears the game. However, there is a live count. If the player reaches 0 lives they lose and must re-enter the maze from the start. There are three different layouts to the maze.
