Create your own interactive simulation based on the programming knowledge you have so far around visuals, movement, images, conditionals, and more. Your simulation can be literal or metaphorical as you wish. It can be playful or very serious, funny or heartfelt, or all of them at the same time. Make something that interests you. Try to work from something you already know about, and do at least some research so you're informed.
